# Overview

**Appconfi** Fast and reliable configuration manager for modern applications that lets your development teams build and deploy applications at the speed your business needs, without compromising on safety. 

You can use it with many similar techniques such as feature flags/toggles, canary releases, soft launches, A-B testing, remote configuration management, phased roll-outs.

## Why use Appconfi?

Cloud-based applications often run on multiple virtual machines or containers in multiple regions and use multiple external services. Creating such a distributed application that's robust and scalable is a challenge.

Various programming methodologies help developers deal with the increasing complexity of building applications. One key recommendation from well-tested architectural patterns is to separate configuration from code. In this case, an applicationâ€™s configuration settings should be kept external to its executable and read in from its runtime environment or an external source.

## Appconfi useful for following scenarios

- Centralize management and distribution of hierarchical configuration data for different applications and environments
- Dynamically change application settings without the need to redeploy or restart an application
- Control of your application feature toggles in real-time
- Share development configurations with your team
